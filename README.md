# hello-world
My first attempt at creating a repository

My name is Jon Taneski, and I help students from the Flatiron School get coding jobs once they graduate from our bootcamp program.

I'm from Australia, and I live in New York. I've worked as a photographer, in public policy, competition regulation and for a consulting company that assists the nonprofit industry.

I'm amazed by the wonderful stories from people that come through our school to launch new careers in code. I'm grateful for the opportunity to help them on their journey.
